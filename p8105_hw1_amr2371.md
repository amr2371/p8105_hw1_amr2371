## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins data set includes species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex and year. Species and
Island standout as important variables.

The data set contains 344 rows and 8 columns. Flipper length has a mean
of 200.9152047mm.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) +
         geom_point()
```

``` r
mean(pull(x_df,1))
```

    ## [1] -0.4963544

``` r
mean(pull(x_df,2))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(x_df,3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(x_df, 3)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(x_df,4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(x_df, 4)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Taking the mean of the random sample gave the correct mean, and taking
the mean of the logical vector gave a mean.Taking the mean of the
character vector and the factor vector did not work.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(x_df, 2))
as.numeric(pull(x_df, 3))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(x_df, 4))
```

When using the ‘as.numeric’ function, the logical vector is converted to
1 and 0 to represent True and False respectively so this is how the mean
was calculated. The character variable is converted to NA since there is
no way to assign a numeric value to characters. The factor vector is
converted to 1, 2 or 3 since there are three levels, but they are still
treated as character variables so R is unable to take the mean.
