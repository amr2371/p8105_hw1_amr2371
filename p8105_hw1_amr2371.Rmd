## Problem 1
```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```
The penguins data set includes species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex and year.

The data set contains 344 rows and 8 columns. Flipper length has a mean of 200.9152mm.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) +
         geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggsave("flipper_bill_scatterplot.pdf")
```

## Problem 2
```{r}
x_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vector_logic = norm_samp > 0,
  char_samp=c("this","is","an","assignment","for","my","data","science","one","class"),
  vector_factor = factor(c("car","bike","plane","bike","bike","car","plane","car","plane","bike"))
)

x_df

```
```{r}
mean(pull(x_df))
```
